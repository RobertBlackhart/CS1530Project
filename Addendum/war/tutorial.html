		<!-- tuturial mode. it's all one page, and doesn't include CSS because I don't know how to do that... hope that's okay.
		I also don't know where the images are being hosted so I just threw them up on imgur. Can easily be fixed. -->

		Addendum is a simple social network aimed at helping students with their classes.
		<br>
		Here's how to make the most of it.
		<br><br>
		
		<b>Profile</b>
		<br><br>

		<br>
		Your profile is how your classmates and other addendum users can learn a little bit more about you. <br>
		You can access your profile by clicking any link that contains your username.
		<br><br>
		
		Change Password allows you to change your password by putting in a new one and confirming it.
		<br><br>
		
		The Trophy Case shows you what trophies you've earned, and which you have yet to achieve.<br>
		Trophies are earned by regularly interacting with Addendum! They have varying degrees of difficulty to get.
		<br><br>
		
		Clicking the Posts tab lists all the posts you've made in reverse chronological order.
		<br><br>

		<br>
		You can also provide addition information about yourself, like your college, real name, and contact info.<br>
		This helps other users in your class identify you, get in contact with you outside of Addendum and learn a little bit about you.
		<br><br>
		You can also look at the profile of any other Addendum users to see this information about them.
		<br><br>
		<b>Class Feed</b>
		<br><br>
		Here's what your class feed will look like. We'll go through a few key functionalities of Addendum.

		<br>
		Right above the posts are tabs for New and Popular. Clicking on a certain tab will yield the same posts, but sorted either by date posted or popularity, respectively.
		<br><br>
		
		Search for a Post will do just that: if you put a search term in the field, it will return a tab of all posts that contain that search term.
		<br><br>
	
		Above your username is a default icon. Hover over that image to produce a Change Image button. This allows you to upload a picture that will accompany all your posts.<br>
		Square icons are recommended.
		<br><br>

		<br>
		Below your icon and username is the link All Classes and Add a New Class. Adding a class is as simple as filling in one search term.<br>
		Looking for a Computer Science class? Boom, look up 'CS'.<br>
		Once a class is added, you can look at posts specifically for that class or posts for everyone.<br>
		Both posts for everyone and for your classes specifically will show up in your All Classes link.

		<br>
		Create a New Post will give you a prompt box to type your post in. You can use the provided tools to edit your post or you can use HTML.<br>
		You can also embed YouTube videos and attach files you think your classmates may find important.
		<br><br>
		
		Excellent posts can be upvoted, which increase their popularity. You can also downvote less-than stellar posts, and comment on posts.
		Brilliant responses to posts can be checked by the user who originally wrote the post.
		<br><br> 
		 
		That's the gist of Addendum! Enjoy the site and Happy Studying!
